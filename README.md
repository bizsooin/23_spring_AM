# Tracking service quality improvement through the online review using SPC & ABSA

This research paper focuses on tracking service quality improvement through online reviews using Statistical Process Control (SPC) and Aspect-Based Sentiment Analysis (ABSA). By leveraging state-of-the-art techniques such as Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and the pre-trained BERT model, the study aims to extract latent topics and sentiment toward specific aspects from a vast number of online reviews. The integration of sentiment analysis results with customer satisfaction scores provides a comprehensive overview of customer experiences. The findings are illustrated using a Statistical Process Control (SPC) chart for trend analysis and anomaly detection. The insights derived from this research have the potential to make substantial contributions to both academic and practical applications in the realms of customer satisfaction and service quality improvement. The innovative approach presented in this paper addresses the limitations of previous methods and provides new opportunities for the field of sentiment analysis.
